## üåç About the Project

**E-Waste** is a mobile application designed to raise awareness about electronic waste (e-waste) and promote responsible disposal and management practices. Built with Thunkable, this app offers a personalized user experience, an engaging educational quiz module, a feedback mechanism, and valuable informational content to empower users. **This application was originally developed in 2021 for a school competition.**

## ‚ú® Features

* **Splash Screen:** A welcoming introductory screen that displays briefly upon app launch.
* **Personalized Onboarding:** Users are prompted to enter their name, which is then dynamically displayed on the main Home screen for a personalized greeting.
* **Informational "About" Screen:** Provides detailed text explaining "What is e-waste? And how do we dispose of it?", offering valuable educational content.
* **Interactive E-Waste Quiz Module:** A dedicated section featuring a 5-question quiz designed to test and enhance user knowledge about e-waste.
    * **Quiz Entry Point:** A specific "QUIZ" screen acts as the hub to start the quiz.
    * **Instant Feedback:** Each quiz question provides immediate visual (changing answer button color to green for correct, red for incorrect) and textual feedback (e.g., "Woohoolll!, correct answer").
    * **Progressive Learning:** Users advance to the next question only upon selecting the correct answer, reinforcing learned information.
    * **Quiz Completion & Replay:** After completing the final question, a "quiz complete" screen is shown, and the app then automatically redirects the user back to the main "QUIZ" screen, allowing for easy re-attempts or further quiz exploration.
* **Personalized Home Screen:** A central dashboard that welcomes the user by their entered name, serving as the main navigational hub of the app.
* **Rating/Feedback Feature:** A "Setting" screen allows users to provide a rating for the app or a specific feature, offering a simple "Thank You So Much" acknowledgment.
* **Intuitive Navigation:** A persistent bottom navigation bar allows for easy switching between key app sections: Home, About, QUIZ, and Setting.
